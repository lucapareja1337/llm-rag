### Model used for this demo
Phi3 is a family of small language models (LLMs) created by Microsoft, focused on high performance, efficiency, and affordability.

Key characteristics:

Efficiency: Trained with synthetic data, they require fewer computational resources and can run on devices with lower processing power, like smartphones and laptops.
Performance: They deliver competitive results in various language tasks, such as translation, writing, and question answering, even compared to larger, more complex models.
Accessibility: Available for free deployment in the Azure, Hugging Face, and Ollama AI model catalogs. Additionally, they offer pay-per-use options through inference APIs.
Versatility: The Phi3 family includes different models with varying sizes and capabilities, catering to diverse needs and use cases.
Applications: They can be used in various areas, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, content generation, text summarization, and machine translation.
What's new:

Phi3-Vision: Launched in May 2024, it's a computer vision model that analyzes and interprets images.
New models: Microsoft announced the future availability of additional models in the Phi3 family, with different sizes and performance levels, aiming to offer even more options to users.
In summary, Phi3 stands out as an innovative and accessible solution for various language and computer vision applications, especially on devices with limited resources.
### Embedding Model
This is a sentence-transformers model: It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 384 dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search.
